Let $D$ be an integral domain. A polynomial $f(x)$ from $D[x]$ that is
neither the zero polynomial nor a unit in $D[x]$ is said to be irreducible
over $D$ if, whenever $f(x)$ is expressed as a product $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, with
$g(x)$ and $h(x)$ from $D[x]$, then $g(x)$ or $h(x)$ is a unit in $D[x]$. A nonzero,
nonunit element of $D[x]$ that is not irreducible over $D$ is called
reducible over $D$.


In the case that an integral domain is a field $F$, it is equivalent and more
convenient to define a nonconstant $f(x) \in F[x]$ to be irreducible if $f(x)$ cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials of lower degree.
